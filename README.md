# Black Carpet


This project focus on visualizing famous actors networks based on what movies they collabed on. With the objective of finding interesting narratives, that may or may not address some social concerns that we hear about in today's news. 
The project takes its name from the traditional Red Carpet and a metaphor of a universe of stars.

You may also associate it with a dark side of the Hollywood shine, the side that doesn't get to be under the obvious spotlight. 
We hope you have fun finding your own discoveries on some visual correlations that this representation may offer.
There's some customizable options that can be combined to show different outputs.
